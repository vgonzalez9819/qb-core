# qb-gear

This resource implements a basic gear and stat system for QBCore.
It is designed to integrate with the TGIANN inventory system and
enables players to equip gear items which grant gameplay bonuses.

The script stores equipped gear in player metadata and calculates
combined stats whenever gear is equipped or unequipped. Stats are
exported so other resources can make use of them.

It contains minimal functionality and should be expanded to suit
your server's needs.
